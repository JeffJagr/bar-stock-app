# Smart Bar Stock – Store Metadata (English)

## Professional app description
Smart Bar Stock is a fast, multi-tenant inventory and ordering app built for bars and restaurants. Owners and managers run multiple venues in one place, while staff use a simple Business ID + PIN login. Real-time Firestore sync keeps every device aligned, with offline-friendly caching and repairable sync. Adaptive Flutter UX works on mobile and desktop, including a PWA dashboard for owners.

## Main features
- Multi-venue support with company codes and role-based access (owner/manager/staff)
- Staff login via Business ID + PIN (no email needed on the floor)
- Real-time inventory updates with Firestore snapshots; manual “Sync” for repair
- Bar, Low-stock, Restock, Warehouse, and Orders views with native-feeling sliders and numeric inputs
- Order history with status filters, date ranges, and export options (CSV/PDF/shareable text for owners/managers)
- Low-stock badge indicators and suggested restock targets
- Session guardrails: inactivity auto-logout, unified logout path, and state observer to prevent invalid sessions
- PWA-ready owner dashboard for desktop browsers (manifest, service worker, installable)
- Print/export support for inventory and order sections

## Example use cases (AU hospitality)
